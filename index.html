    <p>Hello, my Name is Luna and I am a hopeful future horse ownee (I say "ownee" rather than "owner" because it seems they really own you, not the other way around.)This website is for anyone who dreams of having a horse. Whether you are currently looking and ready to take the plunge, or just dreaming of someday belonging to one of these special beings, this is for you!</p>
    <p>What costs are involved in preparing to buy and purchasing your first horse? How do you find one to buy? How do you care for your new horse once you have found them? How do I choose from all of the breeds out there? The goal of this site is to provide some of the answers to these questions and more.</p>
